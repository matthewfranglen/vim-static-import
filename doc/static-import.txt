INTRODUCTION

This plugin allows you to add a static import to the current file based on the
word under the cursor. This searches for another use of the word in an import
and then adds that to the current file.

:AddStaticImport                                             *:AddStaticImport*

    This function will search for the current word under the cursor. If that is
    found as a static import then it will be copied and added to the current
    file.

    You can bind this command to a key. For example:

        nnoremap <leader>I :AddStaticImport

g:static_import_search_dir                         *g:static_import_search_dir*

    This is the path that the search is issued from. This can be changed at any
    point and will take effect from that point onwards.

    This defaults to the folder that you were in when you loaded this plugin.

g:static_import_search_cmd                         *g:static_import_search_cmd*

    This is the command that is run to perform the initial search for the
    static imports. This should only output the matching lines. This will be
    further filtered by grep and is only passed the word under the cursor.

    It is assumed that this behaves similar to grep. An example will clarify
    this:

        grep --recursive ... someStaticImport /a/path/*

    Here the someStaticImport is the word being searched for and the /a/path
    path comes from the g:static_import_search_dir.

    This defaults to:

        grep --no-filename --no-messages --recursive --binary-files=without-match

    It is a very good idea to exclude binary files!
